# MERN Web3 Todo

![MERN Web3 Todo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/mern-web3-todo/main/client/public/logo.svg)

A decentralized todo application built with MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and blockchain technologies. Securely manage your tasks while leveraging the power of distributed technologies.

## Why I Created This Project

This project was primarily developed as a practical exercise to strengthen my MERN stack skills for job interviews and professional development. While my preferred technology stack typically involves Convex and Next.js, I recognized the importance of maintaining proficiency with the MERN stack given its widespread adoption in the industry.

### üíº Skill Development for Job Interviews

My main goal was to create a comprehensive project that demonstrates competency across the entire MERN stack while incorporating cutting-edge Web3 technologies:

- **MongoDB**: Implement proper database schema design and efficient queries
- **Express.js**: Develop a well-structured REST API with proper middleware patterns
- **React**: Showcase modern React practices including hooks, context, and TypeScript
- **Node.js**: Demonstrate server-side JavaScript with proper architecture

By building a complete application rather than isolated components, I created a portfolio piece that showcases end-to-end development capabilities.

### üîÑ Bridging Traditional and Emerging Technologies

The project combines traditional web development with blockchain technologies, demonstrating adaptability with emerging tech paradigms:

- **Web3 Integration**: Practical implementation of blockchain communication
- **Smart Contract Development**: Real-world Solidity development experience
- **Modern Authentication**: Implementation of cryptographic wallet-based authentication

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skill Refresh and Enhancement

This project served as a comprehensive refresh of several key technical areas:

- **TypeScript**: Enhanced type safety throughout the application
- **TailwindCSS & ShadCN**: Modern UI development patterns
- **API Development**: Best practices for RESTful endpoints and error handling
- **State Management**: Implementation of context-based and atomic state patterns

### üìö Creating a Reference Implementation

Beyond personal skill development, this project also serves as my own reference implementation for MERN stack patterns that I can quickly revisit before interviews or when starting new projects.
